### Hello there 👋

- 💬 My name is Mahdi and I've been dealing with code since 1996!
- 💾 My first programming languages were QBasic/GWBasic but the first serious one was FoxPro 2.6 🤷🏻‍♂️
- 👨🏻‍💻 Mostly coded in C#, .NET (since v1.0) and .NET Core and lately Go; currently Node.js and TypeScript, but have tried other languages a little bit too!
- I'm currently working as a Sr. SWE at [Gousto](https://github.com/gousto).
